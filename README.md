# magearna
Sponge Discord bot based on jda, the main feature is the ability to execute minecraft commands through discord, any player can link its account and he will be able to use only the commands that he has the permissions for.
<br>Not going to maintain it, use Nucleus Phonon instead. (don't test the other features, they suck)
